# surrealdb_console

The SurrealDB Console created to showcase the capabilities of the [surrealdb_wasm](https://pub.dev/packages/surrealdb_wasm) package.

With the SurrealDB Console, you can try out [SurrealQL](https://docs.surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/overview) in the browser without installation of the SurrealDB.

A picture is worth a thousand words:-
