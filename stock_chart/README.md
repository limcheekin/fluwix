# stock-chart

If you plan to develop a stock trading application, you definitely come across a requirement: Create the stock price chart using line chart or candlestick chart.

The good news is I found a flutter package known as [trading_chart](https://pub.dev/packages/trading_chart) which did exactly that. What's more? It come with built-in support of the most common stock trading technical indicators such as MACD, RSI, MA, etc.

A picture is worth a thousand words:-

If you are interested to reuse the source code of the screen, please check out the `stock_chart` branch of the git repository hosted at https://github.com/limcheekin/flutter-widgets-explorer. Feel free to fork the repository and send me pull request.

I'd love to hear from you and happy weekend! :)
