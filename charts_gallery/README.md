# charts
The charts gallery screen is taken from official example of the [charts_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/charts_flutter) package. Full credit is given to the development team of charts_flutter.

A picture is worth a thousand words:-

You can see the data visualization capability of the flutter package by running the code in emulator or simply check out the [online charts gallery](https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/gallery.html).

If you are interested to reuse the source code of the screen, please check out the `charts` branch of the git repository hosted at https://github.com/limcheekin/flutter-widgets-explorer. Feel free to fork the repository and send me pull request.

I'd love to hear from you! :)
