# chart-datatable

By standing on the shoulder of the giant, I managed to display the real world quarterly result data (which loaded from a JSON file) as combo chart and tabular format using the [charts_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/charts_flutter) package and the [DataTable](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/DataTable-class.html) widget without too much hassle.  

A picture is worth a thousand words:-

If you are interested to reuse the source code of the screen, please check out the `chart_datatable` branch of the git repository hosted at https://github.com/limcheekin/flutter-widgets-explorer. Feel free to fork the repository and send me pull request.

I'd love to hear from you! :)
