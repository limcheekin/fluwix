# nested-list
The Nested List screen allowed users view more information of a list item without leaving the current listing screen.

It called "Nested List" as the detail of a list item presented as a horizontal list view in a vertical list item of dynamic height which depends on the height of the content of the list item.

The horizontal list view is activated by pressing the arrow button on the right of the list item, then it pull more information of the list item from the back end. The screen was designed in this way to reduce data loaded from the back end when the listing screen is loaded.

A picture is worth a thousand words:-
<br /><img src="images/screenshots.gif" height="480px" width="270px" />

If you are interested to reuse the source code of the screen, please check out the `nested_list` branch of the git repository hosted at https://github.com/limcheekin/flutter-widgets-explorer. Feel free to fork the repository and send me pull request.

I'd love to hear from you whether the project is helpful to you. :)
