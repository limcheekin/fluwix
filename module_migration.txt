2. git merge showcase_view
3. Create module with command: flutter pub run module_starter <module_name>
4. Add module specific dependencies to the pubspec.yaml, used latest version if possible.

9. Run "flutter analyze", then fix all problems.      
10. Test the module by running module's lib/main.dart
