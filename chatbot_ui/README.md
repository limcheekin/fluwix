# chatbot_ui

The Chatbot UI showcase reuses the code from [hadikachmar3/ChatGPT_flutter_course](https://github.com/hadikachmar3/ChatGPT_flutter_course) and interacts with an Echo chatbot instead of the OpenAI API. When you send a message to the chatbot, it will simply echo it back to you.

The idea is to have a generic chatbot UI that can be used for any chatbot or chat-based application.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/hadikachmar3/ChatGPT_flutter_course#readme) of the origin GitHub repo for more information.
