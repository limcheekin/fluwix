## Neumorphic Text

[![text](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic/blob/master/medias/widgets/text.png)](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic)

**Text only handle positive depth**

```dart
child: NeumorphicText(
        "I love flutter",
        style: NeumorphicStyle(
          depth: 4,  //customize depth here
          color: Colors.white, //customize color here
        ),
        textStyle: NeumorphicTextStyle(
          fontSize: 18, //customize size here
          // AND others usual text style properties (fontFamily, fontWeight, ...)
        ),
    ),
```


## Neumorphic Icon

[![custom_shape](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic/blob/master/medias/neumorphic_icon.png)](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic)

```dart
child: NeumorphicIcon(
        Icons.add_circle,
        size: 80,
    ),
```

How to display **SVG** icons ?

Simply use [https://fluttericon.com/](https://fluttericon.com/) to export your svg as .ttf & use NeumorphicIcon(YOUR_ICON) 

[![custom_shape](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic/blob/master/medias/flutter_svg.png)](https://fluttericon.com/)

## üé® Custom Shape

[![custom_shape](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic/blob/master/medias/custom_shape.gif)](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic)

Flutter Neumorphic supports custom shapes, just provide a path to 

```dart
class MyShapePathProvider extends NeumorphicPathProvider {
  @override
  bool shouldReclip(NeumorphicPathProvider oldClipper) {
    return true;
  }

  @override
  Path getPath(Size size) {
    return Path()
      ..moveTo(0, 0)
      ..lineTo(size.width/2, 0)
      ..lineTo(size.width, size.height/2)
      ..lineTo(size.width/2, size.height/2)
      ..lineTo(size.width, size.height)
      ..lineTo(0, size.height)
      ..close();
  }
}
```

And use `NeumorphicBoxShape.path`

```dart
Neumorphic(
  style: NeumorphicStyle(
     boxShape: NeumorphicBoxShape.path(MyShapePathProvider()),
  ),
  ...
),
```

You can import the Flutter logo as a custom shape using 

```dart
Neumorphic(
  style: NeumorphicStyle(
    shape: NeumorphicBoxShape.path(NeumorphicFlutterLogoPathProvider()),
  ),
  ...
),
```

## üî≤ Accessibility / Border

For design purposes, or simply to enhance accessibility, 
you can add a border on Neumorphic widgets 

[![Neumorphic](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic/blob/master/medias/border.gif)](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic)

```dart
Neumorphic(
      style: NeumorphicStyle(
        border: NeumorphicBorder(
          color: Color(0x33000000),
          width: 0.8,
        )
      ),
      ...
)
```

You can enable/disable it (eg: listening an Accessibility Provider) with `isEnabled`

```dart
border: NeumorphicBorder(
    isEnabled: true,
    color: Color(0x33000000),
    width: 0.8,
)
```

Note that `borderColor` and `borderWidth` default values has been added to `NeumorphicThemeData`

## üé® Neumorphic Theme


[![neumorphic_theme](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic/blob/master/medias/toggleDark.gif)](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic)
[![neumorphic_theme](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic/blob/master/medias/toggleTheme.gif)](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic)

```dart
NeumorphicTheme(
    themeMode: ThemeMode.light, //or dark / system
    darkTheme: NeumorphicThemeData(
        baseColor: Color(0xff333333),
        accentColor: Colors.green,
        lightSource: LightSource.topLeft,
        depth: 4,
        intensity: 0.3,
    ),
    theme: NeumorphicThemeData(
        baseColor: Color(0xffDDDDDD),
        accentColor: Colors.cyan,
        lightSource: LightSource.topLeft,
        depth: 6,
        intensity: 0.5,
    ),
    child: ...
)
```

To retrieve the current used theme :

```dart
final theme = NeumorphicTheme.currentTheme(context);
final baseColor = theme.baseColor;
final accentColor = theme.accentColor;
...
```

Toggle from light to dark
```dart
NeumorphicTheme.of(context).themeMode = ThemeMode.dark;
```

Know if using dark
```dart
if(NeumorphicTheme.of(context).isUsingDark){
  
}
```

# NeumorphicApp

You can use direcly in your project a `NeumorphicApp`, surrounding your code

It handle directly NeumorphicTheme & Navigation (and all possibilities of MaterialApp )

```dart
void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return NeumorphicApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'Neumorphic App',
      themeMode: ThemeMode.light,
      theme: NeumorphicThemeData(
        baseColor: Color(0xFFFFFFFF),
        lightSource: LightSource.topLeft,
        depth: 10,
      ),
      darkTheme: NeumorphicThemeData(
        baseColor: Color(0xFF3E3E3E),
        lightSource: LightSource.topLeft,
        depth: 6,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

# What's neumorphic

[![neumorphic](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic/blob/master/medias/neumorphic.jpg)]()

## Material Cards

A Modern / Material (upgraded) card usually is a surface floating on top of our perceived background and casting a shadow onto it. The shadow both gives it depth and also in many cases defines the shape itself ‚Äî as it‚Äôs quite often borderless.

## Neumorphic cards

Neumorphic card however pretends to extrude from the background. It‚Äôs a raised shape made from the exact same material as the background. When we look at it from the side we see that it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfloat‚Äù.

[![neumorphic_button](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic/blob/master/medias/button_press.gif)](https://github.com/Idean/Flutter-Neumorphic)

Here's a Nereumorphic Button tap (slowed x2) from the sample app, you can see how the element seems to change its depth to its surface.
