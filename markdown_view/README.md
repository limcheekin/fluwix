# markdown

The Markdown View will showcase display of markdown file retrieved from Github repository as rich text format. Thanks to [Flutter Markdown](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown) package did the heavy duty, it makes the work a lot easier than I thought.

A picture is worth a thousand words:-

If you are interested to reuse the source code of the screen, please check out the `markdown` branch of the git repository hosted at https://github.com/limcheekin/flutter-widgets-explorer. Feel free to fork the repository and send me pull request.

I'd love to hear from you. :)
