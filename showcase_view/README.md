# showcase_view

Start from now, you can treat Fluwix as a platform to showcase your widget with README, codes and licensing statement. The Fluwix supports Android devices at the moment and will support Web in a week or two. 

That's made possible by the Showcase View widget, let's me show you how it looks:

If the default Read Me, Code and License tabs are not enough for you, the Showcase View widget support additional tabs, please see the following image:

Sound and look interesting? Here is the [steps](SHOWCASE_YOUR_WIDGETS.md) on how to do add your showcase to the Fluwix. I can't wait to see owesome showcases will be created by you!

I think the best way to find out how [Flutter Multi-modules](http://limcheekin.blogspot.com/2021/03/flutter-multi-modules-support.html) works is create the module and try it out yourself. If you don't have any idea, I'm looking for contributors to help on migrate the existing showcases to Flutter modules, so far 5 completed, 9 more to go. If you are interested to help, feel free to look into the [module migration guide](https://github.com/limcheekin/fluwix/blob/main/module_migration.txt). If you're still not turn down by the long list of steps and willing to give me a hand, great! :), kindly open an issue in the [Github issues](https://github.com/limcheekin/fluwix/issues) to tell me which showcase you are interested to migrate.

If you are interested to reuse the source code of the screen, please check out the `showcase_view` branch of the git repository hosted at https://github.com/limcheekin/fluwix. Feel free to fork the repository and send me pull request.

As usual, I'd love to hear from you. :)
